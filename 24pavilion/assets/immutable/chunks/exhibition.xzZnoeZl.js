			Korean Pavilion into an impressive and immersive Korean scent
			journey that include smells that represent different rural areas,
			towns, and cities in South and North Korea. The Pavilion will create
			a captivating environment of intimacy, and through this scent
			journey make a national portrait of the Korean peninsula. A portrait
			that will evoke many different types of memories – a threshold
			between the public and the private, the natural and artificial, the
			physical and the spiritual, the presence and absence of bodies,
			visible and hidden feeling in Korea society.<br/> <br/>
			The perception of scents and odors establishes an effective connection
			to memories and emotions in the recipient, so it is our strong belief
			that KOO JEONG A’s work will unite Korea in a previously unforeseen way.
			Scents are very important because scents create comfort and unconscious
			feelings, scent connects us to our parents from the moment we are born,
			it attracts us to people, places and makes us curious. We know how precious
			the experience of breathing and smelling is – especially after the Covid-19
			pandemic – and the new commission ODORAMA CITIES could awake the senses
			we have lost or missed.</div> <div>The ODORAMA CITIES scents will refresh the pavilion in a surprising
			and unanticipated way. Visitors will be traveling through Korea with
			their visual but most importantly smell senses. The Korean Pavilion
			will be a discrete, elegant, powerful, and sincere way of evoking
			memories and making a portrait of Korea. Through the installations
			KOO engages the audience, challenges us, and triggers our senses in
			multiple ways like no other artists.</div></div>`,a;return t=new $({props:{title:"Exhibition"}}),{c(){d(t.$$.fragment),i=f(),n=v("div"),n.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(e){g(t.$$.fragment,e),i=w(e),n=b(e,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(n)!=="svelte-1hbdci4"&&(n.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){_(n,"class","container")},m(e,s){K(t,e,s),r(e,i,s),r(e,n,s),a=!0},p:m,i(e){a||(O(t.$$.fragment,e),a=!0)},o(e){k(t.$$.fragment,e),a=!1},d(e){e&&(l(i),l(n)),T(t,e)}}}class C extends u{constructor(t){super(),p(this,t,null,x,h,{})}}export{C as E};
