				Born in 1967, Seoul. KOO JEONG A is internationally acclaimed for
				her poetic interventions into pre-existing spaces, which were once
				described “signposts to the inaccessible” that make the space “soul”
				visible. In her practice, architectural elements such as walls, doorsills,
				and windows are combined with texts, drawings, paintings, sculptures,
				films, and installations, also scent, temperature, and sound like
				invisible elements plays significant role in many her works.<br/> <br/>
				To KOO, art functions as a transformer that constantly incites the
				surprise of discovery, audience involvement, extending towards an
				unstoppable state of dynamism that is always oscillating, trembling,
				and vibrating. KOO JEONG A creates and masters both small intimate
				experiences and large- scale impressive works – like the Glow-in-the-dark
				Skatepark series – but her minimal and conceptual approach is always
				elegant, engaging, esthetically pleasing and most importantly it
				is thought provoking. Through the installations she engages the audience,
				challenges us, and triggers our senses in multiple ways like no other
				artist.<br/> <br/> <a href="https://www.koojeonga.com/" class="weak" target="_blank">→ WEBSITE</a>`,V,E,m,c,D,B,_,H="Courtesy of PKM Gallery. Photo by Kim Je Won",L,p,w,F=`<strong>ARTISTIC DIRECTORS</strong><br/> <em>Jacob Fabricius</em> (b.1970, Denmark) is the director of
